# Simple-Image-to-Image
 The script uses Diffusers for image translation from a provided URL and prompt. It sets up a Tkinter GUI for inputting the URL and prompt. After clicking "Generate," it loads the Diffusers model, compiles the UNet model for faster inference, performs translation, and displays the result in the Tkinter window.
Image Translation with Diffusers and Tkinter GUI
This repository contains a Python script for performing image translation using the Diffusers library and displaying the results in a Tkinter GUI. The script allows users to input an image URL and a prompt, and then generates a translated image based on the provided input.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Torch
Diffusers
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-translation.git
Install the required Python packages:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Python script image_translation.py:
Copy code
python image_translation.py
Enter the URL of the input image in the "Image URL" entry box.
Enter a prompt describing the desired image translation in the "Prompt" entry box.
Click the "Generate" button to initiate the image translation process.
The translated image will be displayed in the GUI window.
How it Works
The script imports the necessary libraries, including Tkinter, PIL, Torch, and Diffusers.
It defines a function generate_image() that loads the Diffusers model pipeline, compiles the UNet model for improved inference speed, loads the input image, performs image translation based on the provided prompt, and converts the generated image tensor to a PIL image.
The select_image() function is called when the user clicks the "Generate" button. It retrieves the image URL and prompt from the Tkinter entry boxes, generates the translated image using the generate_image() function, and displays the result in the GUI window using Tkinter and PIL.
