 The script uses Diffusers for image translation from a provided URL and prompt. It sets up a Tkinter GUI for inputting the URL and prompt. After clicking "Generate," it loads the Diffusers model, compiles the UNet model for faster inference, performs translation, and displays the result in the Tkinter window.
